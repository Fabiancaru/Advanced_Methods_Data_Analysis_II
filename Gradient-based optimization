The engine of neural networks

network example transforms its input data as follows: 

$output = relu(dot(W, input) + b)$

In this expression, W and b are tensors that are attributes of the layer. Theyâ€™re called the weights or trainable parameters of the layer 
(the kernel and bias attributes, respectively).
